- [x] I have access to a makerspace 3d printer, can't make infinite print with it tho

# Day 1 ( Feb 21 2025)
I will try to start to work on my 3d printer today.
Not done much yet, found some ressources to help me later (I'm so inexperienced ðŸ˜­)

research : 15 minutes

# Day 2 ( Feb 22 2025)

I'm making a little plan for the printer, like constraint and things :

- I would want to make it USB-C powered ( like proposed in the guide, I don't think it would be _that_ hard

- It **NEED** to be printable by either an Ultimaker 3 or by a Qidi X-one 2

- It will be CoreXY because it look cooler and the afor mentionned printers I have access to are CoreXY, meaning I can study it irl

- I plan to make a custom PCB for a keybad at the front to manually control the extruder's movement and temperature (like the menu in the X-one 2 but physical)

- Print volume will be 180^3mm

After talking a bit with perpelxity.ai, I'm starting to have a better plan about this. 

Research : 1 hour
